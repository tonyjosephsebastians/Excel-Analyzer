## Excel Analyzer - Technical Documentation

### Overview

The Excel Analyzer is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload Excel files, ask questions about the data, and receive answers generated by a language model. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to provide relevant and informative responses.

### Technologies Used

*   Streamlit: For creating the web application.
*   Pandas: For loading and manipulating Excel data.
*   Langchain: To orchestrate the RAG pipeline.
*   Hugging Face Embeddings: For generating embeddings.
*   FAISS: For the vector database.
*   Google Gemini API: For the language model.

### Setup

1.  Install the required libraries:
    `pip install streamlit pandas sentence-transformers faiss-cpu langchain google-generativeai`
2.  Obtain a Google Gemini API key and enter it in the sidebar of the application.
3.  Upload an Excel file using the file uploader.
4.  Ask questions about the data in the text input field.
5.  The application will display the answer generated by the language model.

### Code Structure

*   `app.py`: Contains the main application code, including the UI elements, data loading, chunking, embedding, retrieval, and response generation logic.
*   `run_app.bat`: A batch file that launches the Streamlit application.
*   `documentation.txt`: This file, providing technical documentation for the application.

### RAG Pipeline

1.  **Data Loading:** The application loads the Excel data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Data Chunking:** The data is split into smaller chunks using `CharacterTextSplitter`.
3.  **Embedding Generation:** Embeddings are generated for each chunk using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`.
4.  **Vector Database:** The chunks and their embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database.
5.  **Retrieval:** When a question is asked, the application generates an embedding for the question and searches the vector database for the most similar chunks.
6.  **Response Generation:** The question and the retrieved chunks are passed to the Google Gemini API to generate an answer.

### Batch File

The `run_app.bat` file contains the following commands:

*   `@echo off`: Disables command echoing.
*   `echo Starting Streamlit app...`: Displays a message indicating that the Streamlit app is starting.
*   `streamlit run app.py`: Runs the Streamlit application.
*   `pause`: Pauses the command prompt window after the application is closed, allowing the user to see any error messages.

### Customization

*   The chunk size and overlap can be adjusted in the `app.py` file to optimize the retrieval performance.
*   The language model can be changed by modifying the `model_name` parameter in the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` class.
*   The UI can be further customized using Streamlit's API.

### Troubleshooting

*   If the application fails to start, ensure that all the required libraries are installed and that the Google Gemini API key is valid.
*   If the application returns incorrect answers, try adjusting the chunking parameters or modifying the prompt to the language model.


## Excel Analyzer - User Documentation

### Overview

The Excel Analyzer is a simple tool that lets you ask questions about data in your Excel files and get answers powered by AI.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Install Python:**
    *   Download Python 3.12 from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
    *   Run the installer.
    *   **Important:** Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process. This will allow you to run Python commands from the command prompt.
    *   Complete the installation.
2.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    *   Open a command prompt window.
    *   Type the following command and press Enter:
        `pip install streamlit pandas sentence-transformers faiss-cpu langchain google-generativeai`
    *   Wait for the installation to complete.
### How to Use

1.  **Run the App:** Double-click the `run_app.bat` file. This will open a command prompt window and launch the Excel Analyzer in your web browser.
2.  **Enter API Key:** In the left sidebar, you'll see a field to enter your API key. This is needed to connect to the AI model.
3.  **Upload Excel File:** Click the "Browse files" button to upload your Excel file (`.xlsx` or `.xls` format).
4.  **Ask a Question:** Once the file is uploaded, a text box will appear where you can type your question about the data.
5.  **Get the Answer:** Press Enter or click outside the text box. The AI will analyze the data and provide an answer in a chat-like format below the question box.

### Tips for Asking Questions

*   Be specific with your questions.
*   Use keywords that are present in your Excel data.
*   If you don't get the answer you expect, try rephrasing your question.

### Troubleshooting

*   **App Doesn't Start:** Make sure you have all the necessary software installed (Python, Streamlit, etc.). If you're unsure, contact your system administrator.
*   **No Answer:** Double-check that you've entered your API key correctly. Also, make sure your question is relevant to the data in the Excel file.
*   **Incorrect Answer:** The AI might not always be perfect. Try rephrasing your question or providing more context.

### That's It!

Have fun exploring your Excel data with the Excel Analyzer!
